    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "Beef empanada" refers to an empanada that is filled with beef as the main ingredient. 
      It is a savory pastry turnover where the dough is typically filled with seasoned ground or 
      shredded beef along with various other ingredients such as onions, peppers, garlic, and spices. 
      The filling is then enclosed in the dough, usually folded over in a half-moon shape, and then baked 
      or fried until golden brown and delicious. Beef empanadas are a popular and tasty dish enjoyed in many 
      Latin American and Spanish-speaking countries, as well as in other parts of the world where they have 
      become popular.

      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon chili powder (optional, for some heat)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup pitted green olives, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup raisins (optional, for a sweet touch)</li>
      <li>1 hard-boiled egg, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
      <li>Add the cold, cubed unsalted butter to the flour mixture.</li>
      <li>Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
      <li>Gradually add cold water to the mixture, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together.</li>
      <li>Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to chill.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped onions and red bell pepper, and sauté until they become soft and translucent.</li>
      <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is browned and cooked through.</li>
      <li>Mix in the tomato paste, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, chili powder (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
      <li>Let the beef filling simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
      <li>Remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped green olives, raisins (if using), and hard-boiled egg (if using). Mix everything together. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Take the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into equal-sized portions (about 2 inches in diameter).</li>
      <li>Roll out each portion into a thin circle on a floured surface. Aim for about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
      <li>Place a spoonful of the beef filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
      <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press the edges together to seal the empanada. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
      <li>If you want a golden finish, beat an egg and brush it over the tops of the empanadas before baking.</li>
      <li>Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Bake the empanadas in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
      <li>Once the beef empanadas are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.</li>
      <li>Serve the empanadas warm as a delicious appetizer, snack, or even a main course. They go well with a side of chimichurri sauce or salsa.</li>
